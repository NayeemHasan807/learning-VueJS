1. Use of V-model in form to bind input data with objects in data property of js.
	Here we are dynamically binding the text fields with the object written in data property of js file. This is also called the two way bindings.

2. Work of computed property and the difference between merhods and computed property.
	When we will call function from computed property we wont use parentheses at the end of the function.
	We had seen using console log that the DOM render all the functions in methods property
    whenever a function is called. Because methods property don't know how to render a perticular function.
    So, In big projects when there is a lot of big functions, it will be a huge waste of time is we use 
    the methods property and the DOM start rendering all the functions when a perticular function is called.
    To prevent this we use computed property because computed property only render the function which is called.

3. Use of Shorthand which is quiet handy when a huge lines of code need to be writen.
Useing the shorthand we can use the short way to write directives
    Like for v-on:any_event we can use @anyevents
         for v-bind:any_src we can use :any_source
         for v-slot we can use # 
    Only this three directives has shorthand other directives dont have any short hands
