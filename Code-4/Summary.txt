1. Create Multiple Instance And How TO Use One Instance In Another
	Creating multiple instance and accesing one instance from another one. 
	To get an access of an instance we have to keep that instance in a veriable. 
	Then we can call theat instance by using that veriables.
	Here we are changing the value of the second instance using the first instance method by clicking on the button.
2. Mount & Template
	This is a new property named template where we can write our html using Backtag(``).
	We can also use a variable to write our html if its too large. Then just simpally call the variable.
	unmounted this instace from its element div.
	In the UI the name is not showing because we removed the el property 
    from the instance we created for this div. So this div is now unmounted with its instance.
    We want to show the text after three seconds after the page loads.
    So, we will use setTimeOut function, builtin mount method and template property.
	To use any builtin method we need to use dollar($) sign before it
3. Use of Basic Component
	Inside the component we cant use the data as we used in the instance. In instance we used data as an object.
	But in component we have to use the data as a function and it will return object. Then we will use the template.
	In html file we just have to use the name of the component as a tag apply it.
	Main advantage of the component is we can re-use the component as many time as we want. It will increase the 
	flexibility and save our time.
	Inside the component we wont use any el property.
	This paragraph tag is the name of the component we created on js file
