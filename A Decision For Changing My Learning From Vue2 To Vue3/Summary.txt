Why I started Vue Js:
Vue is lightweight and easy to write. 
Owing to its use of components and familiar templating syntax, migrating or integrating into 
current projects to Vue. js is smoother and faster. 
Hence, Vue is an excellent choice for start-ups but can be utilized in large-scale apps.
I found Vue facinating and I started learing it.

The Reason Why I Am Changing My Learning Module:
Vue was first released the following February, in 2014. In October 27, 2015 the Vue version 1.0 released.
Then in September 30, 2016 the Vue version 2.0 released. After around 4 years in September 18, 2020 Vue version 3.0 released.
The latest vue version is Vue 3.2 which was released in August 5, 2021.
The source from where I started learing Vue is https://v2.vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html. 
This is the documentation of Vue2. Which is backdated and will vanish in the end of 2023. 
If I continue learning Vue2 then in the long run it won't help me much. Till now I just learned the 
basics of Vue2 and strated learing Vue Cli. Now I want to shift to Vue3.
Vue3 is said to be faster, smaller, more maintainable and easier to target natives compared to Vue2.
It is now officially the default version of Vue.js. 
By using it, I will be future-proofing my skills to stay relevant with this cutting-edge technology.

Things I Need To Do Right Now:
From now on I have to follow Vue3 documentation from https://vuejs.org/.
I will also follow there official courses on https://www.vuemastery.com/courses
Most of the basics of Vue2 and Vue3 are same. 
Some new syntax, features, functions and rules may added and some may changed. 
I will go through all the basics again from Vue3 documentation.
It will take some time but okay for me. I will try my best to learn Vue3 from basics to advance level. 
No matter how long it may takes I will finish it.
